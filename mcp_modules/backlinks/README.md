  }
}
```

## Configuration

### API Key Requirements

**No environment variables needed** - all API keys are passed directly in request bodies:

- **ValueSERP API Key**: Required for site discovery (passed in `/discover` requests)
- **Email Provider**: Required for follow-ups (Mailgun or SMTP credentials in `/follow-ups` requests)
- **Optional**: Moz, Ahrefs, or other SEO APIs can be integrated as needed

### Campaign Settings

```json

## Best Practices

### 1. Respectful Crawling

- Built-in delays between requests
- Respects robots.txt when possible
- Rate limiting to avoid overwhelming target sites

### 2. Content Quality

- Always review generated content before submission
- Customize descriptions for better relevance
- Use specific, relevant keywords

### 3. Follow-up Strategy

- Wait at least 1-2 weeks before sending follow-ups
- Keep follow-up emails professional and brief
- Track response rates and adjust strategy

### 4. Monitoring & Optimization

- Regularly check campaign analytics
- Focus on high-scoring sites for better results
- Adjust keyword strategy based on performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Browser Launch Failures**

   - Ensure system has sufficient resources
   - Check Puppeteer installation
   - Verify no conflicting browser processes

2. **Site Discovery Returns Few Results**

   - Broaden keyword selection
   - Increase maxQueries parameter
   - Check internet connectivity

3. **Form Submission Failures**

   - Sites may have changed their form structure
   - CAPTCHA protection may be enabled
   - Consider manual submission for high-value sites

4. **Email Follow-ups Not Sending**
   - Verify SMTP configuration
   - Check email credentials
   - Ensure firewall allows SMTP connections

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting the environment variable:

```bash
DEBUG=backlinks:*
```

## Security Considerations

- API keys and credentials are never logged
- Browser instances are properly cleaned up
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Respects site terms of service
